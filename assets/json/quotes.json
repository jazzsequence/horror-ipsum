	"Why would you say that I am insane?",
	"I wouldn't say that I've lost my mind simply because I've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods.",
	"The book awoke something dark in the woods...",
	"It got into my hand and it went bad...",
	"So I lopped it off at the wrist.",
	"You SHALL DIE!",
	"YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE NECRONOMICON.",
	"WE SHALL FEAST UPON YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF MAN!",
	"Did you speak the exact words?!",
	"Well, maybe not every single syllable, no.",
	"But basically I said them. Yes...",
	"Dung eating fool! Thou hast doomed us.",
	"When thou misspoke the words the Army of the Dead was awoke...",
	"Because of you...we are doomed.",
	"It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration...",
	"But someone was expecting us Trevor.",
	"And everything went according to plan.",
	"We were about to come for Kirsty.",
	"When we were offered a deal...",
	"A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn.",
	"The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty.",
	"Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor. Reality.",
	"Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft?",
	"From the witching end, not the hunting...",
	"These desecration's in the church - you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?...",
	"And Dennings, you read how he died? Yeah, a fall.",
	"Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential.",
	"Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards...",
	"Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.",
	"It looks like a type of disorder that you rarely ever see anymore, except in primitive cultures...",
	"We call it a somnambuliform possession...",
	"Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will...",
	"Have you ever heard of exorcism?",
	"It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit.",
	"Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you...",
	"You might loosen the straps then...",
	"I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan...",
	"I'm not Regan...",
	"I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras...",
	"And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!",
	"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?",
	"That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras...",
	"Where's Regan?...",
	"In here. With us.",
	"Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it...",
	"If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?", 
	"But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?",
	"It would bring us together...",
	"You and Regan?",
	"You and us.",
	"How long are you planning to stay in Regan?",
	"Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.",
	"You keep it away...",
	"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! It burns! Ohhhh! It burns!",
	"You'd like that?",
	"Intensely...",
	"Especially important is the warning to avoid conversation with the demon.",
	"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous.",
	"He is a liar, the demon is a liar.",
	"He will lie to confuse us.",
	"But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.",
	"The attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful.",
	"So don't listen, remember that, do not listen...",
	"I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.",
	"So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced -",
	"There's only one.",
	"I know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil.",
	"A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night.",
	"And it wants the exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth.",
	"It doesn't care that is already had that chance ...once.",
	"Now listen closely because there isn't much time. Listen and believe, because it's all true.",
	"I first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin.",
	"The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.",
	"It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection.",
	"It was never meant for the world of the living.",
	"The book awoke something dark in the woods.",
	"In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole.",
	"A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked.",
	"...I just didn't plan on coming along.",
	"Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites!",
	"Hail!",
	"Only the Necronomicon has the power.",
	"A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.",
	"The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.",
	"It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one.",
	"Other Warriors have tried. Their widows grieve still.",
	"We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it.",
	"Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.",
	"Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home.",
	"Rest in pieces.",
	"This must be it. The cemetery.",
	"Wait. Three books? Nobody said anything about that.",
	"Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!",
	"KLATOO!... VERATA... uh... Uh... Necta... uh... Nectar... Necktie... uh...",
	"KLATOO... VERATA... NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...",
	"Did you bring the Necronomicon!",
	"Now send be back. Like in the deal.",
	"No...I sensed something had gone awry. The book's power. It's gone.",
	"The passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book.",
	"And they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall rule the Earth for one thousand years...Because of you...we are doomed.",
	"It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration.",
	"But someone was expecting us Trevor. And everything went according to plan.",
	"The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty.",
	"The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we were very impressed.",
	"Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know.",
	"And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with child.",
	"They were all real screamers too. We had a blast. And there was one more.",
	"You've seen many things you wished you hadn't. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues in our little puzzle.",
	"Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement?",
	"WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET?",
	"No... no...",
	"Open this and your problem will disappear forever.",
	"Good morning Madame.",
	"Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.",
	"There's not a day in my life when I don't feel like a fraud. I mean priests, doctor, lawyers I've talked to them all, I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.",
	"From the psychiatric end.",
	"I know. I read it.",
	"These desecration's in the church, you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?",
	"Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.",
	"You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?",
	"Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.",
	"Sick priest, is that it?",
	"Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.",
	"I don't know anyone who fits the description.",
	"Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?",
	"No I probably wouldn't.",
	"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.",
	"Is that a threat?",
	"No, I mentioned it only in passing.",
	"Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.",
	"Hey, Father? You like movies?",
	"Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest little guy. Then one day he got sick and died. My heart was broken. My whole body hurt.",
	"Hey, kids still trying to decide on the right costume? Well why not head on down to Randall's Penny Save located on Kimball Rd. just off route 1 in Mackin County.",
	"Choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers... everything you need for your Halloween needs.",
	"Alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear's Picnic.",
	"I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.",
	"I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.",
	"So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, \"do you smoke?\" The guy say, \"yeah\"... the devil say, \"great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had.\"",
	"Then the devil asks, \"do you drink?\" Guy says, \"yeah\"... devil say, \"wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff.\"",
	"Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.",
	"I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.",
	"I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.",
	"I ain't no rich man, but I see the truth. You do not have to go to Hell. You are in Hell. This is Hell. All American Hell. ...true heaven in my hands... I'm gonna blow Satan back through the door to Hell.",
	"Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God. To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish.",
	"Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning him- self with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray...",
	"...showing clearly 29 sewing needles inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of 65.",
	"To your right. One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein.",
	"Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn.",
	"And now I would like to introduce a local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse Nellie and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.",
	"Murderer, torturer amd most of all master surgeon.",
	"Mr. Quale an intern at Willows State Mental Hospital, nicknamed Weeping Willows for its neverending cries of pain, took great pleasure in control.",
	"Through primitive brain surgery. Mr. Quale was captured when local police raided his secret underground laboratory.",
	"He was discovered in the middle of performing a gruesome lobotomy on a young, female victim.",
	"Legend has it that Dr. Satan is still alive and living out his evil fantasies right here in Ruggsville County.",
	"And now, if you follow me, please be careful, the lights in this section aren't what they use to be.",
	"I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight...",
	"I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.",
	"Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home.",
	"Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.",
	"Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.",
	"I know it's hard to understand, but I really want to see this tree.",
	"OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but I still say it is a waste of time.",
	"I like sleep.",
	"We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.",
	"Ugh, what's that smell?",
	"OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.",
	"I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea.",
	"Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them.",
	"I'm sure it would be very amusing.",
	"No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere...",
	"I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?",
	"Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?",
	"A dead one.",
	"I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.",
	"What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.",
	"Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?",
	"That's not something to joke about.",
	"OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.",
	"Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.",
	"Mary, I'm sorry but he left without me. Mary... come on, you don't think I'd leave you stranded out there.",
	"Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell him we're gonna be late. Can I use your phone?",
	"No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.",
	"Your hands, please. Your left hand shows your past... ...and your right hand shows your future.",
	"I can do it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet.",
	"So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?",
	"Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.",
	"And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.",
	"Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.",
	"Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.",
	"There well, who knew there was love to be found in The Old Dark House.",
	"Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic... are you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?",
	"OK, everyone, put on your masks. We can't very well eat with our everyday faces exposed.",
	"Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?",
	"It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks...",
	"I know all about what you want to know about.",
	"Otis! I can't believe you decided to come down and join us... and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special night... all my babies together.",
	"Now, I don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr.",
	"From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum.",
  "He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.",
	"But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right?",
	"I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.",
	"Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in the fire if I told ya you'd see Hell...",
	"For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.",
	"No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.",
	"This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.",
	"It is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour.",
	"Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work... so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic... The House of Frankenstein.",
	"A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them.",
	"In the Dark. In the night.",
	"It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection.",
	"They can smell life.",
	"Smell blood.",
	"I have bad dreams.",
	"Just look at me, you can tell that I have terrible dreams.",
	"The town is full of walkers.",
	"Every town is full of walkers.",
	"These aren't just walking.",
	"They're like...regular folks.",
	"Hell, dead folks is near as dumb as me!",
	"You learned how to make yourself useful.",
	"That's what they're doing.",
	"Put some flowers in the graveyard.",
	"These here flowers ain't the kind you lay down on the ground.",
	"These here are sky flowers.",
	"Wind, you are a thousand eyes - but never seen.",
	"A thousand caresses - but never touched.  A thousand voices - but never a word.",
	"Wind - I love you with that which is endless",
	"It's about fear, Michael.  Fear is the loss of an anchor.  You must find your place amongst everything.  Then the fear will leave - and then you can decide what gets in - and what doesn't.",
	"There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.",
	"It's the legacy, Michael.  The gift.  And the price.",
	"It began before time, it seems, the price we pay for the power - and it has gone on - mother to daughter... brother to sister... father to son... and on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...",
	"The Mayfair pact. Rowan: when I am flesh - I will unlock the door - and the witches will come through.",
	"You thought I could not see into your soul...?  I made your soul!",
	"It is Christmas Eve, my love  The witching hour is at hand,",
	"Do you wanna die tonight, Cici?", 
	"What's your favorite scary movie?",
	"The shadows lengthened as the cold wind whispered secrets of forgotten souls.",
	"A scream echoed in the darkness, leaving only a chilling silence in its wake.",
	"Blood-red moonlight bathed the haunted woods, revealing eyes watching from the gloom.",
	"The old mansion creaked with every step, as if alive and breathing in the darkness.",
	"A sinister laughter rang out from nowhere, a promise of terror yet to come.",
	"In the fog, figures moved slowly, their faces blank and eyes empty.",
	"The chill in the air deepened, the whispering voices drawing nearer.",
	"Footsteps followed her, though she walked alone on the abandoned road.",
	"The ancient graveyard came alive under the lightning's flash, casting skeletal shadows.",
	"A door slammed shut upstairs, though the house had been empty for years.",
 	"In the ultimate climes of the pole--that groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek.",
	"In the realms of the boreal pole.", 
  	"The mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had ever conceived them.",
	"Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes--viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells--rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile--slaves of suggestion, builders of cities--more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and more articulate, more and more eager to resemble the beings they feared.", 
	"He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about 'the black pit,' 'the carven rim,' 'the proto-Shoggoths,' 'the windowless solids with five dimensions,' 'the nameless cylinders,' 'the elder pharos,' 'Yog-Sothoth,' 'the primal white jelly,' 'the color out of space,' 'the wings,' 'the eyes in darkness,' 'the moon-ladder,' 'the original, the eternal, the undying,' and other bizarre conceptions;  but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years.",
	"Danforth, indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library.", 
	"At the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single, mad word of all too obvious source: 'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!'", 
	"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras--dire stories of Celæno and the Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition--but they were there before.",
	"They are transcripts, types--the archetypes are in us, and eternal.",
	"How else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us at all?",
	"Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury?",
	"Oh, least of all!",
	"These terrors are of older than the body.",
	"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.",
	"We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.",
	"The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.",
	"It must be allow'd that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Dæmons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the Loud Noises by Night, the Beacon-Fires on the Hills, and the Unwonted Dying of Cattle.",
	"For a while the dogs howled on, but their voices sank to a kind of throaty, shuddering whimper, and all the while they crept back from the glen, yelping, as if dragged against their will.",
	"People used to whisper of an old Indian ruin on top of Sentinel Hill, where, before the coming of the white men, the powwows had made devil's bargains in the blackest times of the moon.",
	"Queer how fish and frogs went, and that awful smell--guess I shan't eat any more of 'em.",
	"It must be allow'd that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Dæmons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the Loud Noises by Night, the Beacon-Fires on the Hills, and the Unwonted Dying of Cattle.",

	"These terrors are of older than the body.",
	"Out of space--out of the spheres of time and matter--out of the world of our primitive ancestral fears--the ray streamed down.",
	"It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes.",
	"As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see.",
	"For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountains, it seemed to spread out like a limitless expanse of greenish ice-crystals.",
	"They were the mates of those which had toiled on the walls of this monstrous pile, and their masters were the mates of those which had warred on the Kadath in the cold waste men call the Plateau of Leng.",
	"There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration.",
	"All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!",
	"When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith." ,
	"Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons, and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet.", 
	"Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate's frightened description.",
	"Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on the broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs.", 
	"I mention his talk about angles because of what my uncle later told me about the non-Euclidean angle in the bas-relief which Legrasse and his men took from the swamp folk.",
	"He had, he said, while delirious, been held captive in that monstrous place for untold hours, and had learned much of a terrible, ultimate truth concerning the origin of life on this planet; a truth which made it necessary for him to unite with those who would destroy certain hideous models, which the First Men had over-rashly formed after the work of the Great Old Ones had supplied an excessively fecund earth with organic life.",
	"They were not composed altogether of flesh and blood, for though they had shapes assumed in dim eras of evolution and in forgotten oceans, they were not always those shapes, and it was theirs to mould and keep on moulding matter and its entities.",
	"Great God!  That Bottomless Pit!  Those Cyclopean walls and shimmering ramparts!  What a race could have shaped them, rearing them in this abiding solitude of ice and death?",
	"He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone--whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong--and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: \"Cthulhu fhtagn,\" \"Cthulhu fhtagn.\"",
	"These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's dream-vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply that they had no business being uttered close to me by this extremely sensitive youth.",
	"I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me.",
	"But I do not think my life will be long.", 
	"As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go.", 
	"I know too much, and the cult still lives--even though dead Cthulhu still slumbers in R'lyeh.", 
	"The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.", 
	"After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.",
	"Three men were swept off into the sea by the gigantic tentacles; Johansen swears he was flung to the deck by a vast TEMPLATE OF JELLY WHICH NO HARPOON COULD HOLD.",
	"With it shall go this record of mine--this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again."
