	"Why would you say that I am insane?",
	"I wouldn't say that I've lost my mind simply because I've heard the voices and seen the godless things moving in the woods.",
	"The book awoke something dark in the woods...",
	"It got into my hand and it went bad...",
	"So I lopped it off at the wrist.",
	"You SHALL DIE!",
	"YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE NECRONOMICON.",
	"WE SHALL FEAST UPON YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF MAN!",
	"Did you speak the exact words?!",
	"Well, maybe not every single syllable, no.",
	"But basically I said them. Yes...",
	"Dung eating fool! Thou hast doomed us.",
	"When thou misspoke the words the Army of the Dead was awoke...",
	"Because of you...we are doomed.",
	"It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration...",
	"But someone was expecting us Trevor.",
	"And everything went according to plan.",
	"We were about to come for Kirsty.",
	"When we were offered a deal...",
	"A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn.",
	"The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty.",
	"Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor. Reality.",
	"Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft?",
	"From the witching end, not the hunting...",
	"These desecration's in the church - you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?...",
	"And Dennings, you read how he died? Yeah, a fall.",
	"Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential.",
	"Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards...",
	"Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.",
	"It looks like a type of disorder that you rarely ever see anymore, except in primitive cultures...",
	"We call it a somnambuliform possession...",
	"Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will...",
	"Have you ever heard of exorcism?",
	"It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit.",
	"Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you...",
	"You might loosen the straps then...",
	"I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan...",
	"I'm not Regan...",
	"I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras...",
	"And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!",
	"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?",
	"That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras...",
	"Where's Regan?...",
	"In here. With us.",
	"Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it...",
	"If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?", 
	"But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?",
	"It would bring us together...",
	"You and Regan?",
	"You and us.",
	"How long are you planning to stay in Regan?",
	"Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.",
	"You keep it away...",
	"Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! It burns! Ohhhh! It burns!",
	"You'd like that?",
	"Intensely...",
	"Especially important is the warning to avoid conversation with the demon.",
	"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous.",
	"He is a liar, the demon is a liar.",
	"He will lie to confuse us.",
	"But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.",
	"The attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful.",
	"So don't listen, remember that, do not listen...",
	"I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested.",
	"So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced -",
	"There's only one.",
	"I know now that there is such a thing as a living Evil.",
	"A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night.",
	"And it wants the exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth.",
	"It doesn't care that is already had that chance ...once.",
	"Now listen closely because there isn't much time. Listen and believe, because it's all true.",
	"I first saw the damn thing at that blasted cabin.",
	"The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.",
	"It contained bizarre burial rites, prophesies...and instruction for demon resurrection.",
	"It was never meant for the world of the living.",
	"The book awoke something dark in the woods.",
	"In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole.",
	"A hole in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked.",
	"...I just didn't plan on coming along.",
	"Hail to him who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terror of the Deadites!",
	"Hail!",
	"Only the Necronomicon has the power.",
	"A power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the Evil from this place and return you to your time.",
	"The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's the thing that got me here.",
	"It is in a place far from here. It can only be retrieved by the Promised one.",
	"Other Warriors have tried. Their widows grieve still.",
	"We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it.",
	"Alone must thou travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.",
	"Me? Now way, no day. Only place I'm goin' is home.",
	"Rest in pieces.",
	"This must be it. The cemetery.",
	"Wait. Three books? Nobody said anything about that.",
	"Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!",
	"KLATOO!... VERATA... uh... Uh... Necta... uh... Nectar... Necktie... uh...",
	"KLATOO... VERATA... NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...",
	"Did you bring the Necronomicon!",
	"Now send be back. Like in the deal.",
	"No...I sensed something had gone awry. The book's power. It's gone.",
	"The passage is useless to us as long as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book.",
	"And they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall rule the Earth for one thousand years...Because of you...we are doomed.",
	"It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration.",
	"But someone was expecting us Trevor. And everything went according to plan.",
	"The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty.",
	"The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we were very impressed.",
	"Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know.",
	"And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with child.",
	"They were all real screamers too. We had a blast. And there was one more.",
	"You've seen many things you wished you hadn't. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues in our little puzzle.",
	"Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement?",
	"WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET?",
	"No... no...",
	"Open this and your problem will disappear forever.",
	"Good morning Madame.",
	"Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.",
	"There's not a day in my life when I don't feel like a fraud. I mean priests, doctor, lawyers I've talked to them all, I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.",
	"From the psychiatric end.",
	"I know. I read it.",
	"These desecration's in the church, you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?",
	"Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.",
	"You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?",
	"Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.",
	"Sick priest, is that it?",
	"Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.",
	"I don't know anyone who fits the description.",
	"Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?",
	"No I probably wouldn't.",
	"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.",
	"Is that a threat?",
	"No, I mentioned it only in passing.",
	"Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.",
	"Hey, Father? You like movies?",
	"Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest little guy. Then one day he got sick and died. My heart was broken. My whole body hurt.",
	"Hey, kids still trying to decide on the right costume? Well why not head on down to Randall's Penny Save located on Kimball Rd. just off route 1 in Mackin County.",
	"Choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers... everything you need for your Halloween needs.",
	"Alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear's Picnic.",
	"I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.",
	"I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.",
	"So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, \"do you smoke?\" The guy say, \"yeah\"... the devil say, \"great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had.\"",
	"Then the devil asks, \"do you drink?\" Guy says, \"yeah\"... devil say, \"wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff.\"",
	"Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.",
	"I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.",
	"I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.",
	"I ain't no rich man, but I see the truth. You do not have to go to Hell. You are in Hell. This is Hell. All American Hell. ...true heaven in my hands... I'm gonna blow Satan back through the door to Hell.",
	"Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God. To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish.",
	"Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning him- self with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray...",
	"...showing clearly 29 sewing needles inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of 65.",
	"To your right. One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein.",
	"Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn.",
	"And now I would like to introduce a local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse Nellie and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.",
	"Murderer, torturer amd most of all master surgeon.",
	"Mr. Quale an intern at Willows State Mental Hospital, nicknamed Weeping Willows for its neverending cries of pain, took great pleasure in control.",
	"Through primitive brain surgery. Mr. Quale was captured when local police raided his secret underground laboratory.",
	"He was discovered in the middle of performing a gruesome lobotomy on a young, female victim.",
	"Legend has it that Dr. Satan is still alive and living out his evil fantasies right here in Ruggsville County.",
	"And now, if you follow me, please be careful, the lights in this section aren't what they use to be.",
	"I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight...",
	"I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.",
	"Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home.",
	"Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.",
	"Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.",
	"I know it's hard to understand, but I really want to see this tree.",
	"OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but I still say it is a waste of time.",
	"I like sleep.",
	"We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.",
	"Ugh, what's that smell?",
	"OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.",
	"I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea.",
	"Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them.",
	"I'm sure it would be very amusing.",
	"No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere...",
	"I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?",
	"Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?",
	"A dead one.",
	"I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.",
	"What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.",
	"Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?",
	"That's not something to joke about.",
	"OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.",
	"Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.",
	"Mary, I'm sorry but he left without me. Mary... come on, you don't think I'd leave you stranded out there.",
	"Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell him we're gonna be late. Can I use your phone?",
	"No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.",
	"Your hands, please. Your left hand shows your past... ...and your right hand shows your future.",
	"I can do it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't dead yet... so don't you and your sister start counting out my money yet.",
	"So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?",
	"Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.",
	"And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.",
	"Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.",

	"Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic... are you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?",

	"It's all talk, yakty yak, like a bunch of hungry chipmunks...",
	"I know all about what you want to know about.",
	"Otis! I can't believe you decided to come down and join us... and you brought little Wolf. This really is a special night... all my babies together.",
	"Now, I don't know where you heard all your little fairy fables about Dr.",
	"From a Captain Spaulding down at some museum.",
  "He tells cute little tattle-tales to sell his junk, but he don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.",
	"But something happened, right? I mean the story is based on a real incident, right?",
	"I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.",
	"Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in the fire if I told ya you'd see Hell...",
	"For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.",

	"That's what they're doing.",
	"Put some flowers in the graveyard.",
	"These here flowers ain't the kind you lay down on the ground.",
	"These here are sky flowers.",
	"Wind, you are a thousand eyes - but never seen.",
	"A thousand caresses - but never touched.  A thousand voices - but never a word.",
	"Wind - I love you with that which is endless",
	"It's about fear, Michael.  Fear is the loss of an anchor.  You must find your place amongst everything.  Then the fear will leave - and then you can decide what gets in - and what doesn't.",
	"There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.",
	"It's the legacy, Michael.  The gift.  And the price.",
	"It began before time, it seems, the price we pay for the power - and it has gone on - mother to daughter... brother to sister... father to son... and on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...",

	"In the fog, figures moved slowly, their faces blank and eyes empty.",
	"The chill in the air deepened, the whispering voices drawing nearer.",
	"Footsteps followed her, though she walked alone on the abandoned road.",
	"The ancient graveyard came alive under the lightning's flash, casting skeletal shadows.",
	"A door slammed shut upstairs, though the house had been empty for years."
